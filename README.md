## üìò Overview
**XURL** is a URL shortening utility designed to generate and retrieve short URLs for lengthy URLs, making them easier to use and share. This project focuses on implementing URL shortening and mapping functionality from scratch, leveraging core Java concepts.

During this project, we:
- Built a short URL library with essential methods.
- Created a registration method for converting long URLs to short URLs.
- Implemented a lookup method to retrieve original URLs from their shortened versions.
- Added a hit counter to track the usage of each URL lookup.
- Validated the implementation with comprehensive test cases.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Structure

### **XURL Interface**

### Scope of Work
- Developed a **concrete class** implementing a short URL interface with methods to create and manage URL mappings.
- Created a method to accept a long URL as input, generate a **random 9-character short URL**, and return it.
- Stored mappings in a **HashMap** for efficient lookup.
- Enabled custom short URLs by accepting a long URL and custom short URL as input.
- Implemented **error handling** to ensure each long URL maps to only one short URL (and vice versa).
- Added functionality to:
  - **Lookup** the long URL for a given short URL.
  - **Delete** a URL mapping based on the long URL.
  - **Track hit count** for each URL to monitor lookup frequency.
- Verified the functionality with **unit test cases**.
